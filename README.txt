2) To add a new body open the PlanetData.txt file and type it in this format (with each data entry seperated by a space) and increase the variable ArrayIndex in the Main.java file by however many more you wish to add:
Name Mass InitialXPosition InitialYPosition InitialZPosition InitialXVelocity InitialYVelocity InitialZVelocity
3) The x, y and z position output of the program will be in the GravSimOutput.txt file.
4) There is a GravitationalParticleSimulation report included which analyses the simulation results.
5) It was created in the Atom text editor so the indentation may be off a bit in other text editors.
